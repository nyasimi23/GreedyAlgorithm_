Title: Greedy Algorithms

Introduction:
Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of finding a global optimum. These algorithms are simple and efficient, making them useful for solving optimization problems. This text file provides an in-depth explanation of how greedy algorithms work and discusses their properties, advantages, and limitations.

1. Algorithmic Paradigm:
   - Greedy algorithms follow a specific algorithmic paradigm, which involves making the best possible choice at each step without considering the overall consequences.
   - The algorithm builds a solution incrementally by selecting the locally optimal choice at each iteration, assuming that this choice will lead to the globally optimal solution.
