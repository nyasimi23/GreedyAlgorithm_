# Approximation algorithm

This PHP script implements an algorithm to find the optimal list of stations that can cover a given list of states. It is based on the concept of finding the maximum coverage by selecting stations intelligently.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of states that need to be covered and a list of stations along with the states they cover, the objective is to find the minimum number of stations required to cover all the states.

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have PHP installed on your system.
2. Open the `Algorithm.php` file in an IDE.
3. Modify the `$states_needed` array to include the list of states you want to cover.
4. Modify the `$stations` array to include the stations and the states they cover.
5. Save the file.
6. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `coverage.php` file.
7. Run the script by executing the command: `php coverage.php`.
8. The script will calculate the optimal list of stations and display the result.
